                  <h2>Understanding Body Weight and BMI</h2>
                  <p>
                    Maintaining of healthy body weight is essential to overall well-being. One of the most widely used tools for assessing weight status is the Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a numerical value calculated from height and weight, offering insight into whether an individual falls within a healthy range.

                  <p>
                    While BMI doesn't measure body fat directly, it's a useful screening tool to identify weight-related health risks. It categorizes individuals into underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on the result. By understanding your BMI, you can take steps toward balanced nutrition, physical activity, and lifestyle improvements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Whether youâ€™re starting a fitness journey or simply tracking wellness goals, calculating your BMI is an excellent first step.
